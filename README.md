# Introduction
You're a wizard, stuck in a prison full of guards. You have to escape, without being seen. But the guards won't make it easy for you, as they all watch different angles and patrol through the building.

This was an assignment for the course Game Design 1 at DAE. We got 2 keywords that we had to brainstorm around. It was also the first time that I worked in Unreal and the first time that I had to create my own game idea from scratch. I had a lot of fun and this definitely motivated me to get more into game design. 

# Goal
It was my goal to combine the stealth and puzzle genre to create a unique game experience that would spark the player their creativity. I wanted to make a game that could have multiple levels with multiple solutions.
